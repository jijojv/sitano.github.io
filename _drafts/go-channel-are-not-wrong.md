title: Go channels are not wrong (slow mutexes), but you are
---

This post appeared as an attempt to analyze popular trend lately
in the Go community to write an articles usually called: go channels
are slow compared to whatever (mutexes, ring buffers, etc) - you
name it. Which I personally think are not a) correct, b) they tend
to urge people in what channels actually are not in its nature, thus
rising incorrect understanding of its nature and semantics.

I will address to those articles:
