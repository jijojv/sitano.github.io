### Hey there! My name is Ivan Prisyazhnyy.

I am a Backend system engineer.
(Linux, Distributed systems, Scalability, High Load)

I started coding from very early age (in 90s).
I fall in love with computers and hacking games with a
hex editors and SoftICE. Later my way laid through
Unix books, C++ to managed languages, from dynamic to
static ones.

I always liked networks and distributed things. So
i put an effort into it finally revealed my self in the
field of: linux world of distributed scalable fault tolerant
reliable systems. (I have tried to fell in love with frontend
developing many times but found it too boring)

My passion is looking for a new concepts and things,
discover new technologies and ideas in applied languages,
so i ended up with a huge bunch of tech i have tried.
I can code in any C-style language (C, C++, Objective C,
Asm, C#, Java, Scala, Erlang, Go, JavaScript, Python,
Ruby, HTML, ...).

Finally i am proficient in Java, Scala, JavaScript (Node.JS),
Go, C#, PowerShell, Bash for last 8 years. Also, I am a fan of
twitter, facebook, google, amazon open source stuff.
Lastly i am looking at haskell, erlang and rust.
Also i am fan of Colemak, Vim, Emacs, IntelliJ and MacBook.

My hobby is to reverse engineer managed languages.
