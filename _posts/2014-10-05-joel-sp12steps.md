On Wednesday, August 09, 2000 famous Joel Spolsky wrote his great article
[The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html).
It is so amazing, this thing written more than 10 years ago and
is popular right now as never before. All that stuff became part of
best practices long time ago already. So many OSS systems were created
to help you follow this hints along your developing process.

So, working here in Russia, i decided to extend this list to help backend
developers to rate their workplaces and companies they are tend to work at.
